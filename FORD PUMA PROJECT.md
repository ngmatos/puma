Alterações/Aspetos importantes:

***Motor***

1. Revised ECU mapping (1.7 only)
1. Completely new inlet manifold with plenum chamber
1. Reworked airbox, with resonator removed and additional cold air feed
1. Mildly revised camshafts, retaining the variable cam timing (1.7 only)
1. New larger bore exhaust manifold and system, with sport cat replacing the original close coupled cat

1. The FRP’s engine management map can be uploaded onto any “TAPE” (digital dash) or “MUFF” (analogue dash) powertrain control module. If your car doesn’t have one of these, you will need to acquire one, ideally with two working transponder chips so you can reprogram your existing keys. The FRP map can be added as a standalone option, and is reputed to add a few extra BHP. It also increases the rev limit to around 7,200rpm, and reduces the impact of the torque limiter in first and second gears. Various specialists can upload this map, with prices typically ranging from £100 - £250.

1. The FRP inlet manifold is a great bolt-on unit. Not only does it look good, but it also increases power by around 8 BHP. This component can be fitted to any Zetec-SE engine (1.25, 1.4, 1.6. 1.7). Unfortunately only around 600 were made, most of which are (hopefully) still fitted to FRP’s, and used prices remain high, typically from £500-£800.

1. The airbox modification is very cost effective and while it won’t make a vast difference, I noticed that inlet temperatures drop much quicker under an open throttle than without the extra cold feed. Again, this can be performed on any Puma, and the benefits should be similar.

1. The FRP camshafts are another step towards the magical 155PS, they aren’t especially aggressive and shouldn't have an especially detrimental impact upon drivability. The original cams were made by Piper, however replicas are available from various sources.

1. The original exhaust manifold, with it’s close coupled catalyst is quite restrictive. There are really two common types of 4-2-1 performance manifold, those which are copies of the FRP manifold and have a flange to connect to the mid / sport cat, and those with a flexi-pipe and sleeve fit connections. The first type are manufactured by Janspeed (mild steel original FRP and stainless FRP copy, made on original FRP jigs), Piper, Protek and Milltek. The mild steel Janspeed is prone to corrosion, and there were a few questions regarding the quality of the stainless steel Janspeed, but I believe users are generally happy. Piper and Milltek are both perceived to be good quality, though the flanged Milltek does apparently hang a bit lower than any of the other makes. The only point with the Protek is that some users have questioned the quality of the flange mounting, both in terms of the welding, and the angle. Each of these FRP copy systems should be interchangeable with each other.

When fitting any of these flange type manifolds, it is important to use spring bolts from the manifold to the next section of exhaust, be that a plain mid-section, decat or sport cat. The original system on a standard car has a flexi-pipe to absorb engine movements relative to the body of the car, these systems do not, hence the spring bolts. It would also be a good idea to replace your torque restrictor, this is the rear engine mount which limits the amount the engine can rock back and forth. The FRP had an updated item, but a new standard item should be fine.

In addition to the FRP copy manifold, Milltek also offer a manifold with a flexi-pipe and a sleeve fitting. This is supposed to have slightly better ground clearance than the standard Milltek. The sleeve mounts also make it easier to improve the alignment of the system, which you can’t really do with the flange mounts.

When fitting any new exhaust manifold it is a good idea to replace the exhaust manifold gasket. These are quite cheap and are available from your local Ford parts counter. You will also need to extend the lambda sensor wiring. While earlier cars only have one lambda sensor, mounted before the cat, later cars are fitted with two, with the second going after the cat to check that the cat it reducing the emissions from the level measured at the first sensor. The only sensor that affects fuelling is the first one. This will need to be extended by around 450mm to reach the sensor mounting hole at the bottom of the 4-2-1 manifold. Ford did offer an extension loom for earlier single lambda cars, but it is quite straightforward to make your own using a lambda plug and socket from a scrap yard, and the appropriate length of 5A wire.

It is only beneficial to extend the second lambda if you are going to fit a sport cat, and there is a provision behind the sport cat for the second lambda. If there isn’t, or if you aren’t going to use a cat, then your best bet is to just unplug the blue lambda and ignore the inevitable Check Engine Light (“CEL”, AKA “MIL”). Your other option is to fit a TAPE ECU (centralina utilizada no FRP) which doesn’t use the second lambda, or the CEL.

If you are running a sport cat, it is important to be aware that the CEL may still come on. The 1.6 engine when fitted to the Focus is very sensitive of aftermarket catalysts, which can make the CEL come on after only a few months, though I haven’t heard of this problem with the 1.7. Also, the original cat is mounted close to the engine so it will get up to it’s optimal operating temperature as quickly as possible, while a sport cat is located further away, and is less restrictive, which both mean it takes longer to get up to an efficient operating temperature, and can therefore cause the CEL to come on.

You can make a “MIL Eliminator”, this is a device that plugs into your second lambda to make the ECU think that the emissions measured at sensor 2 are lower than sensor 1. Quite cheap to make yourself, but reliability can be questionable. I made one and it was rubbish, so I switched to a TAPE ECU, latterly running the FRP map.

The original FRP exhaust system has three parts, manifold, mid section with integral sport cat, rear box. The only silencer is the rear box, there is no silencer in the mid section. Both Milltek and Piper made copies which were interchangeable with each other and the original. I believe the stainless steel Janspeed kit should also be interchangeable. Milltek sleeve fit systems are not interchangeable with their flange fit systems, also Piper do a cat-back system, which is not compatible with their manifold, as it is smaller diameter and was developed before the FRP was launched. Piper also do their own system, which is compatible with FRP copy manifold, but is not compatible with anything else further down the line.

One thing to be aware of is that the standard FRP system does sit quite low at the rear centre elbow, this isn’t a problem, but can’t be easily adjusted, and can be prone to catching on the ground.

Something to be aware of is that lambda sensors seem to have a shorter life in cars fitted with a 4-2-1 manifold. This isn’t a huge factor, but is something to be aware of.

Beyond the FRP engine modifications, a ported head is a good way of liberating more power, but is typically quite expensive. Could see an additional 8-15BHP though, in conjunction with the other breathing modifications.

Induction kits – there are mixed views on these, in my opinion if Tickford / Ford thought they were good, then they would have been used on the FRP, but they didn’t, instead they used a modified standard item. Generally speaking, so long as you don’t mount the cone where it will get wet, they can be beneficial, in terms of noise if nothing else!

Something that some people on zsoc.com have tried is the fitment of the 1.7’s alloy inlet manifold and larger throttle body, to the 1.6 engine. There doesn’t seem to be a definitive view on this, but it is unlikely to do any harm, and may well add an extra horse or two.

Another option is to “flow” the air flow meter and throttle body, this should enable the cool air to enter the inlet with fewer restrictions, improving throttle response along the way. I am unaware of any proven power gains from this modification, but those who have done it speak highly of the improvement in throttle response.
